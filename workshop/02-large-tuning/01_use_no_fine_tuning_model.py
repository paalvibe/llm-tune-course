# MAGIC ## Applying T5 without Fine-Tuning
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To start, these examples show again how to apply T5 for summarization, without fine-tuning, as a baseline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Helpful tip: set `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` to a consistent location on `/dbfs` across jobs, and you can avoid downloading large models repeatedly.
# MAGIC (It's also possible to set a cache dir for datasets downloaded from Hugging Face, but this isn't relevant in this example.)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Install packages
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We need some bleeding edge packages to get it to run.
# MAGIC These must be installed in each notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install 'accelerate>=0.20.3' datasets evaluate rouge-score

# MAGIC ## Produce reviews with off the shelf model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Applying an off-the-shelf summarization pipeline is just a matter of wrapping it in a UDF and applying it to data in a Spark DataFrame, such as the data read from the Delta table created in the last notebooks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - `pandas_udf` makes inference more efficient as it can apply the model to batches of data at a time
# MAGIC - `broadcast`ing the pipeline is optional but makes transfer and reuse of the model in UDFs on the workers faster 
# MAGIC - This won't work for models over 2GB in size, though `pandas_udf` provides another pattern to load the model once and apply it many times in this case (not shown here)

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Summaries of individual reviews are interesting, and seems to produce plausible results. However, perhaps the more interesting application is summarizing _all_ reviews for a product into _one_ review. This is not really harder, as Spark can group the review text per item and apply the same pattern. Below we have:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Creating a pipeline based on `t5-large`
# MAGIC - Broadcasting it for more efficient reuse across the cluster in a UDF
# MAGIC - Creating on an efficient pandas UDF for 'vectorized' inference in parallel
